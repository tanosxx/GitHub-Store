/**
 * Identifies the "variant" of a GitHub release asset — the part of the
 * filename that stays stable across releases (architecture, packaging
 * flavour, etc.) so the user's choice can survive a version bump.
 *
 * # Why this is non-trivial
 *
 * Release filenames are wildly inconsistent. The naïve approach
 * (substring after the version segment) breaks on a handful of common
 * shapes:
 *
 *   - **Arch-before-version**: `app-arm64-v8a-1.2.3.apk` — version is at
 *     the end, the variant token is in front of it
 *   - **Counter between version and arch**: `app-1.2.3-beta.1-arm64-v8a.apk`
 *     — substring tail would include `beta.1`, drifting release-over-release
 *   - **Version-code-only naming**: `app_1234_arm64-v8a.apk` — no dotted
 *     version anchor
 *   - **OS-version interlopers**: `app-android-12.0-1.2.3-arm64.apk` — the
 *     OS version is the first dotted-digit substring
 *
 * # The strategy
 *
 * Three layers of identity, each cheaper to compute than the next, all
 * consulted when matching against a fresh release:
 *
 *   1. **Token-set fingerprint** ([extractTokens]): pulls a *set* of
 *      well-known arch / flavor / qualifier tokens out of the filename
 *      regardless of position. Two filenames are "the same variant" if
 *      their token sets are equal. This is the primary identity and
 *      handles arch-before-version, OS-version interlopers, and counters
 *      in one go.
 *
 *   2. **Glob-pattern fingerprint** ([deriveGlob]): replaces version-shaped
 *      substrings with `*` (and digit-only run substrings with `*`),
 *      yielding e.g. `app-*-arm64-v8a.apk` from `app-1.2.3-arm64-v8a.apk`.
 *      Used as a secondary key when the token vocabulary doesn't recognise
 *      anything in the filename — covers custom flavor names like
 *      `myapp-foss-1.2.3.apk` → `myapp-foss-*.apk`.
 *
 *   3. **Substring-tail extract** ([extract]): the legacy fallback. Kept
 *      for surface compatibility with the existing UI (badge labels) and
 *      because it's a cheap way to display *something* readable to the
 *      user when the token vocabulary returns nothing.
 *
 * # Vocabulary policy
 *
 * The token vocabulary is intentionally a closed set. Open-ended token
 * extraction (e.g. "anything that's not a digit run") leaks app names,
 * release qualifiers, and date components into the variant identity,
 * which is exactly what the substring-tail approach gets wrong. The
 * vocabulary covers the tokens that actually distinguish APK variants
 * in the wild — architectures, install flavors, signing qualifiers.
 *
 * Casing is normalised to lowercase before comparison; some maintainers
 * flip casing release-over-release.
 */
object AssetVariant {
    /**
     * Closed vocabulary of tokens that are meaningful for variant
     * identity. Anything *not* in this set is considered noise (app name,
     * release qualifier, date component, etc.) and is ignored.
     *
     * Architecture tokens dominate the list because that's the most
     * common variant axis on Android. Flavor tokens (`fdroid`, `play`,
     * `foss`, `gms`, `nogms`, `huawei`) cover the second-most-common
     * axis: same arch, different distribution channel.
     *
     * `release` and `signed` are explicitly excluded — they appear in
     * a lot of filenames but rarely *distinguish* assets within a
     * single release. Including them would create false negatives
     * when one release uses `release-arm64-v8a` and the next uses
     * `arm64-v8a`. Same reasoning applies to `aligned`, `unsigned`.

     *    can still pin the right variant from the picker UI.
